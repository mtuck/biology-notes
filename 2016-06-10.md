### Endosoymbiosis
  * chloroplast and mitochondria- evolved from bacteria living w/in eukaryotic cells

* Flagella (long) and Cilia (short) - help swimming action. difference in flagella and cilia is just length
* animal sperm - posterior push
* flant sperm - push
* lungs have ciliated lining
SEM - surface detail
TEM - internal detail

Central Vacuole- hold ware "pumps cell up" turgor pressure in botanical creatures. pushes against cell walls
  - animals do not have central vacuole
plant cell wall- algae bacteria fungi and plants all have cell walls
cotton- cellulose
lignin- makes cell wall hard

can cross membrane by diffusion passivie transpor - diffusion through a protein channel

passive transport happens from high to low concentration
active transport
exocytosis

energy = capacith to do work
  forms:
    heat
    chemical
    light electrical and mechanical
  Cannot be created or destroyed
  
* energy can change form
  * ex blender. electrical to mechanical
  * ex plants light to chemical - photosynthesis
* transfers lose some energy as heat
  * heat = random motion = loss of order
* __EntropyK__ measure of disorder
* cells ave low entropy
* keeping order requires constant energy input
* simple diffusion active and passive transport
