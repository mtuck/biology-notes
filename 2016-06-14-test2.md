##### Respiration(two meanings)
  1. Breathing (gas exchange: C02 & O2)
    * lungs gills skin
    * insects breathe through numerous opening leading to branched air-tubes (not through their mouth)
       * insects bllod do not carry oxygen through blood
  2. Cellular repiration - extracting energy from carbs 
    * sugar --ATP--> co2
    * 
* ATP - Adenosine triphosphate
    * ATP energy carrier
    * about 1/2 pound of atp in your body. carries AA battery worth of energy
    * like rechargeable battery
      * cell recharges 10Mil ATP molecules per sec
* ATP powers every movement and action of an enzyme's active site
* ATP(fully charged) breaks to [ADP and P]"low charge" and releases energy from breaking apart
* To put [ADP and P] back together you need energy
* Glucose and carbs releases electron to put ATP back togeter
* __Electron Carriers__ take electrons from carbohydrates and deliver them to a process that forms ATP
* NAD+ picks up electrons (becoming NADH) cannot hold any mor electrons
* NADH delivers electrons (becoming NAD+) loses hydrogen with electron
* Cellular respiration releases the energy of carbohydrate producting ATP
  * 1 glucose yields 36 ATP
* Three stages of Aerobic Respiration
  1. Glycolysis
    * Glucose(6 carbon) ---Glycolysis--> pyruvate (2) (3 carbon sugar- half a glucose)
