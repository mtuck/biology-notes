# life of a cell; The Cell cycle
1. __interphase__
  * cell grows larger and is very active
  * if cell is to divide, DNA is synthesized and chromosomes duplicate
2. __Cell division__ (mitosis or meiosis)
 * red blood cells cant complete the cycle but white blood cells can
 * When copmpleted produces new cells

__Neoplasms (tumors)__ develop if cell cycle control genes fails.  
 1. __Benign__ - adhere
 2. __Malignant__ - migrate

cancer cells adhere poorly and migrate establishing new tumors
__Metastasize__ - cancer spreading

##### Skin Cancers
1. basal cell
2. squamous cell
3. malignant melanoma


##### Mitotic Cell Division
* __Mitosis__ - clonal cell division as chromosmes do the following
1. Condense
2. Align
3. Separate
 * sister chromatids are pulled 
4. and decondense- as daughter nuclei form and parent cell divide's its cytoplasm into two cells
* interphas chromosomes are long and thin they condense at start of mitosis and avoid entanglement


##### Meisosis- a diploid cell divides forming four haploid cells; requires 2 divisions; chromosome # is halved 
First division is meiosis I
1. diploid cell divides producing 2 haploid cells
 * synapsis- physical pairing of homologous chromosomes 
   * During synapsis crossing over occurs- exchange of dna between non sister chromatids a source of genetic variation
   * Homologues separate
   * dauter cells are haploid
 * crossing over
 

Meiosis II - __MISSING notes__ sister chromatids separate

Daughter cells produced by meiosis (unlike mitosis) are not genetically identical.
1. Crossing over- shuffles genes between homologues: crossed over chromosomes have new combinations of alleles
2. independent assortment - each chromosome pair segregates independently of other pairs

in diploid cell genes occur in pairs \
geonotype = combination of alleles for the gene pair

fertiliztion (fusion of gametes) restores diploid condition in the zygote
In humans, the zygote divides by mitosis producing the next person

 somatic (body) cells and embryos
