1. __What are the properties of life?__  
  1. Energy- living organisms convert energy from one form to another
  2. Organized structure- complex properties emerge from the interacstion of simpler pars
      The same, basic organic molecules are arranged in various ways giving us the various cell types of our body.
      levels of organization extend from the subcellular to broad cosystems.
  3. Grow and reproduce- DNA holds the code for building the organization of life and fro reproductin its own kind

2. __What are the natural sciencs?__

3. __How are the natural sciences different from math, history, art, economices, i.e. the humanities and social sciences?__

4. __What are the major attributes of the scientifice method and the natural sciences?__

5. __Structure of the atom: atomic subparticles (protons, neutrons, electrons) and their basic properties.__

6. __Cheemical symbols for elements; atomic number & isotopes; ions, function of ions in your body.__

7. __Chemical bonds: ionic bonds, covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds__

8. __Molecules: polar vs nonpolar molecules.__

9. __Under what conditions does water flow uphill against the pull of gravity and without from-behind pressure pushing it uphill?__

10. __Organic molecules: the four major categories and their subunits, examples and functions of molecules within each category.__

11. __The cell thoery__

12. __Prokaryotic vs eukaryotic__

13. __The components of all living cells__

14. __Components of eukaryotic cells and their functions__

15. __Fluid mosaic model__

16. __Why are cells small? surface area to volume ratios based on size of the object__

17. __Evolution of cell complexity. The origin of mitochondria and chloroplast.__

18. __The concept of energy and entropy.__

19. __How is energy stored and released by living organisms at the cellular-molecular level?__

20. __How do cells acquire and release chemicals and thereby maintain their functional integrity?__

21. __How do plants capture the energy of the sun? In what form is the captured energy stored?__


Viruses are non living organisms but contain genetic material.
Mycology- study of fungi
Entomology- study of insects
Environmental Changes
  - negative impacts
    - harmful algae blooms
  - invasive species (both plants & animals)
    - compete with or kill native species
__bioprospecting__- search for new drugs biochemicals and genes
__Humasn and other sepecies__
  - love
  - hate/fear
  - indifferent
- Edward o wilson
  - etomologist, naturalist, scientist
  - studied ants went to harvard
  - writer
  - book titled __Biophilia__ The emotional affiliation we have for other living organisms
  - talked about how genes affect everything(not true)

__Sources of knowledge__
* Research based 
  * humanities (lit., art, history);
  * Mathematics; Logic
  * Science

* belief fields
  * Religion ethics morality
  * Political ideology
  
__Natural Sciences__- to understand the natural world
* biology physics astronomy chemistry geology
* Limited to natural explanations. Real and observable stuff

__Traits of Science__
* critical thinking: judging the quality of information before accepting it
  * embraces skepticism
* independent, rational thought informed by evidence
* be aware of your bias
* Science is a human endeavor; imperfect; self-correction [stem cell story]
