#### 1. Glycolysis (cytoplasm)
  * One glucose + 2 Atp --glycolysis--> 4 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 pyruvate
  * Net yield 2 ATP
  * Delivers electrons to electron carrier (NADH)
  * Split glucose to get 2 pyruvate

#### 2. Krebs cycle(__Mitochondrion__)
* uses 2 pyruvate yielding 2 ATP
* 2pyruvate --__krebs cycle__--> 6C02 + 2ATP + NADH + FADH<sub>2</sub>
* Delivers electron to electron carriers (3rd stage)
* 2 pyrovates -> 6CO2

#### 3. Electron Transfer phosphorylation
* oxygen + NADH + NADH + FADH<sub>2</sub> --__Electron transfer phosphorylation__--> 32ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O 
* Electrons are released to give energy to put ATP together
* Electrons are picked up by oxygen which then attach to 2 hydrogen ions producing H<sub>2</sub>O
  * Oxygen is final electron acceptor
* Requires <sup>e</sup> delivered by carriers from Glycolysis and Krebs Cycle
* Requires O<sub>2</sub> as final e acceptor
* Produces H<sub>2</sub>O when O<sub>2</sub> + H<sup>+</sup> accept 
* Produces greates ATP yield [32] as e<sup>-</sup> passed to lower energy state.

## II Aanerobic respiration (Low oxygen)
* ex gut of cow, yest, poop, and Anaerobic exercise
* 2 stages  
  * Glycolysis (produces 2 ATP)
  * Fermentation (does not produce ATP)
    * Restores electron carriers needed for glycolysis
  
#### __Lactate Fermentation__ - animals
  * __Pyruvate__ converted to __lactate__
  * lactate has more electrons associated with it
  * __pyruvate__ takes electrons from electron carriers to produce __lactate__
  * pyruvate --NADH NAD+--> lactate
  * empties electron carriers for glycolysis

#### Alcholic Fermentation - Yeast and Plants
* Pyruvate converted to CO<sub>2 + alchohol
  * process removes electrons from electron carriers
* pyruvate --NADH NAD+--> ethanol + carbon dioxide
* yeast can only stand about 12 percent alcohol
*

# CH 6 DNA structure and Function

#### I. Chromosomes "colored bodies"
* strand of a sigle dna molecule of histome protiens
* make identical copy to become 2 chromatid chromosome
* Connected at __Centromere__
* different chromosome have centromere at different points and be different length
* 23 unique chromosomes in humans


* each __chromatid__ is a long DNA wound around __histone proteins__
* # of chromosomes in a nucleus
 * can't see them to count when they are not condensed they are like tangled fish line
 * chromosomes get condensed at cell division and become visible
 * number of chromosomes depend on animal
 * __Karyotype__ - image of chromosomes arranged by size and shape
 * __Autosomes__ - all chromosomes but the sex chromosomes. 22 pairs
 * __Sex Chromosomes__ - 1 pair, relate to sex, but  carry genes for nonsexual traits such as blood clotting
  * men get hemophilia more often than women
 * XY male &#9794;  XX female 
 
 ##### karyotypes show:
  * each cell with 2 of each kind 46 total
  * 2 of same kind = __homologous chromosomes__
   * same size shape and carry same sequence of genes one inherited from each paren
  * 1 of each different kind = a set of chromosomes 
   *  You inherited one set of 23 from each parent for a total of 46
 
  * 1 set = n (__haploid__)
  * 2 set = 2n (__diploid__)
  * __Ploidy__ - # sets of chromosomes
   * __Diploid__ (2n) - 2 sets, 2 of each kind
   * __Haploid__ (1n) - 1 set - a whold complete set

#### DNA - The Double Helix
* __James Watson__ and __Francis Cris__ and a female (watson was a substandard human)
* 4 types of __nucleotides__
* 2 pairs of complementary nucleotides
 * Adenine - Thymine 2 hydrogen bonds
 * Cytosine- Guanine 3 hydrogen bonds
* __DNA__ - double stranded, latter-like. Base pairs are the "rungs"
* 3 billion base pairs in hjman genome; chromosomes #1 with 249 Million base pairs
* Only one side has gene other side is dummy and only for reproducing
* Code is read three neucleotides at a time
* Variations in base sequence is foundation of life's diversity

1. __Replicates__ (chapter 6)
2. Stores coded information (Ch. 7)
3. DNA mutates (saved for Ch. 7)
