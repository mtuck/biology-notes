*__Chloroplasts__ - organelles of photo synthesis
* __ETP__ - electron transfer phosphorylation 
    * adds phosephase to another molecule
    * ADP + P -> ATP
    * Series of proteins in chloroplast membranes
    * joins two photosystems
    * passes electrons to lower energy state
    * energy give off is used to assemble ATP
* uses atp to put carbons together 
* ATP produces carbohydrates
* ### know z-scheme _ figure 5-6 pg 86
* __know chlorophyll__

## Ligh dpendent reactions of photosynthesis
* green wave length is reflected and not used as much
* photolysis - takes e- from water, thus splitting water into H+ and O2
* occur across inner membranes of chlorplast
* produce O2 (as meta bolic waste)
* prduce H+
* consume H20
* require photosystems
* photolysis occurs
* electron transfer phosphorylation occurs
* x-scheme explains
* __Carbon fixation__ - inorganic carbon dioxide fixed to glucose
    * conversion of inorganic carbon into organic molecules
    * occurs in fluid beyond the stacks of inner membranes
* __calvin-benson cycle__(means of carbon fixation) - consumes atp and CO2 produces glucose
* carbon fixation - accumates as plant growth
* importance of photynthesis- produces food 
* 
##### Fossil fuels
* 350 million years agon carboniferous period
* Buried became coal

##### Atmospheric effects of co2
* Created 02 rich atmosphere 2 BillionYA 
   - prerequisite to aerobic lif and life on land
   - 3 O2 -> 2O3 in stratosphere
   - Removes CO2 a greenhouse gas

#### Getting Food 
* Autotrophs, self feeding (carbon fixers)
